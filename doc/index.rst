NRM-Core Documentation
======================

The following is a guide for the core NRM logic, written in Haskell. These
docs are primarily of interest to NRM developers.

If you know about NRM and are just looking to get it to run on your
application or use ``nrm`` and ``nrmd``, please visit
the :doc:`quickstart <nrm-home:quickstart>` guide.

Please refer to the :doc:`libnrm <nrm-home:libnrm>` guide for
application-instrumentation.

Finally, the Haddock documentation is available below and to the left:
